Dear applicant,

in this repository you can find test tasks, that we would like to ask you to do. The most important thing we are looking for in the candidates is the ability to write clean maintainable code. In the final solution we expect to see a good object oriented structure, usage of standards, programming principles, maybe design patterns, if appropriate. How will it look does not matter so much. You can earn extra points if you are good with HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript, but it is not required. We respect your time and do not want to take too much of it.

You can freely choose one or several of the following tasks:
 - [Planet Dates](planet-dates.md)
 - [Mini Database](mini-database.md)

Everything that is not explicitly stated in the task, you can define as you like. The main thing that will be evaluated is the quality of the code. The result can be sent to per E-Mail in a zip archive or uploaded to any git hosting.

If we like how you solved the task, we will invite you to the interview in our office to meet you personally.

We hope the tasks are also a little fun.
